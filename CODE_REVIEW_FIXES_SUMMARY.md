# Code Review Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented based on the code review findings.

## Security Fixes

1. **Critical Security Vulnerability Fixed**: 
   - Replaced `eval()` with `json.loads()` in `backend/ai_generator.py` line 158
   - This prevents potential code injection attacks through tool arguments

## Backend Improvements

2. **CORS Configuration Enhanced**:
   - Restricted CORS origins in `backend/app.py` lines 27-28
   - Changed from `["*"]` to `["http://localhost:8000", "http://127.0.0.1:8000"]` for better security

3. **Duplicate Import Removed**:
   - Removed duplicate `from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles` import in `backend/app.py`

4. **Error Logging Improved**:
   - Added traceback information to error logging in `backend/rag_system.py` lines 51-53 and 102-104
   - This provides better debugging information when errors occur

5. **Chunk Overlap Calculation Simplified**:
   - Simplified the overlap calculation logic in `backend/document_processor.py` lines 67-75
   - Made the overlap calculation more predictable and easier to understand

6. **Filter Building Logic Improved**:
   - Simplified the filter building logic in `backend/vector_store.py` lines 118-130
   - Removed redundant conditions and made the code more straightforward

## Frontend Improvements

7. **Source Parsing Made More Robust**:
   - Added error handling and validation to source link parsing in `frontend/script.js` lines 155-176
   - Added try-catch block to handle parsing errors gracefully
   - Added validation for source text and link before creating links

8. **Event Handling Simplified**:
   - Simplified event delegation pattern in `frontend/script.js` lines 36-48
   - Replaced complex event delegation with direct event listeners for better readability

9. **Debug Statements Removed**:
   - Removed all `console.log` statements from `frontend/script.js`
   - Kept only necessary error logging with `console.warn` and `console.error`

10. **Cache-Busting Parameters Removed**:
    - Removed hardcoded version parameters from CSS and JS links in `frontend/index.html` lines 10 and 84
    - This makes the HTML cleaner and avoids manual version management

## Code Quality Improvements

11. **System Prompt Formatting Enhanced**:
    - Improved readability of system prompt formatting in `backend/ai_generator.py` lines 65-69
    - Used explicit if-else instead of ternary operator for better clarity

All identified issues from the code review have been addressed with these changes.
